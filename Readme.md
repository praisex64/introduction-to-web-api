# INTRODUCTION TO WEB API

## What is An API

API or application programming interface enable different software systems to interact with each other by defining a standard way for them to exchange data and functionality. They act as intermediaries between software applications, allowing them to communicate with each other without requiring the developers to know the internal workings of each other's systems.

APIs are typically used to enable communication between web-based applications, but they can also be used for other types of software. For example, an API could allow a mobile application to interact with a cloud-based database or an Internet of Things (IoT) device to send and receive data from a server.

In essence, an API defines a set of rules for how software applications should communicate with each other, including the format and structure of the data that is exchanged, the types of requests that can be made, and the responses that will be provided. By providing a standard way for software applications to interact with each other, APIs make it easier for developers to build complex systems that are composed of multiple interconnected components.


In the restaurant analogy, An API, or Application Programming Interface, can be compared to a waiter at a restaurant.

Just as a waiter serves as the intermediary between a customer and the kitchen, an API acts as a mediator between a user and a software application.

In a restaurant, a customer communicates their order to the waiter, who then relays the order to the kitchen. The kitchen prepares the food, which is then brought back to the table by the waiter. In the same way, a user interacts with an API by sending a request for data or functionality, and the API responds by providing the requested information or performing the requested action.
