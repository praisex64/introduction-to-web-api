# INTRODUCTION TO WEB API

## What is An API

API or application programming interface enable different software systems to interact with each other by defining a standard way for them to exchange data and functionality. They act as intermediaries between software applications, allowing them to communicate with each other without requiring the developers to know the internal workings of each other's systems.

APIs are typically used to enable communication between web-based applications, but they can also be used for other types of software. For example, an API could allow a mobile application to interact with a cloud-based database or an Internet of Things (IoT) device to send and receive data from a server.

In essence, an API defines a set of rules for how software applications should communicate with each other, including the format and structure of the data that is exchanged, the types of requests that can be made, and the responses that will be provided. By providing a standard way for software applications to interact with each other, APIs make it easier for developers to build complex systems that are composed of multiple interconnected components.

## A Layerman's Persepective

In a layerman's perspective, if you have browsed the internet today, used the Google Maps to locate places, used search engines (like Google, Bing, Yandex), make an online or banking transaction, booked a car/transport service (like Uber or Opay), access weather information, used some of your messenger app (such as Whatsapp, Tiktok, Facebook, Instagram), search for jobs on interfaces like (LinkedIn, Indeed, Jobberman, Twitter), etc., you have used some API services knowingly or unknowingly. These communications were possible with the help of an API. Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as Smart TVs, Smart Refrigerators, sensors and actuators that power these devices are possible through the help of APIs. API serves the intermediary or middleman role by connection your client/host to these endpoints. "I will call API the backbone of modern communication in information technology". Just like any other software, APIs have their Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and are designed by the Backend developers. - By Tope Taiwo.
