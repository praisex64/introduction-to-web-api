# INTRODUCTION TO WEB API

## What is An API

API or application programming interface enable different software systems to interact with each other by defining a standard way for them to exchange data and functionality. They act as intermediaries between software applications, allowing them to communicate with each other without requiring the developers to know the internal workings of each other's systems.

APIs are typically used to enable communication between web-based applications, but they can also be used for other types of software. For example, an API could allow a mobile application to interact with a cloud-based database or an Internet of Things (IoT) device to send and receive data from a server.
